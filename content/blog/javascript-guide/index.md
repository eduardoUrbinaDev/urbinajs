First of all, the most important thing you need to know about Javascript:
everything is an object.

## Value Types

To better understand the world we live in, we assign data to anything. There are diffent kinds of data to describe different kinds of things.
For example, we can number our age, tell our name, count our money, or even save a full profile
in our favorite social network with our birth date, school, email and more! The important thing is to know which type of value fits best.

## Numbers

In Javascript, numbers can be decimal, floating, hexadecimal, octadecimal or binary.

```Javascript
5 // decimal
3.14159 // floating
100000 // a big (but not so much) decimal number
```

## Strings

They are called strings because they are a bunch of single characters.
In Javascript, you can single quote (' ') or double quoute (" ") any text you want.
Your name, last name, a country or a place. Anything that can be named can be put between quoutation marks.

```Javascript
'John'
"Doe"
"15 Street Name 01800"
'555-000-1234'
```

There isn't any difference between single or double quote, it mostly depends on
the convention you (or an organization) want.

## Boolean

This type of value is very simple, it's true or false. It's important to remember
these words are keywords, and they should never be used rather than to tell if a
condition is met (true) or not (false)

```Javascript
true
false
```

## Some other

The issue here is.
